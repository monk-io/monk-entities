## What is this integration?
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.

## What Monk manages
- IAM Policy, IAM Role, IAM User

## What the Agent can do and how to use it
- **User Management**: Create, update, and delete IAM users with access keys and passwords
- **Role Creation**: Define IAM roles with trust policies and managed policies
- **Policy Management**: Create custom policies with JSON policy documents and attach to users/roles
- **Group Administration**: Organize users into groups and manage group permissions
- **Access Key Rotation**: Generate and manage access keys with rotation capabilities
- **Policy Validation**: Validate policy syntax and check for overly permissive permissions
- **Service Accounts**: Create service accounts for application authentication
- **Cross-Account Access**: Configure roles for cross-account resource access

Steps:
1) Ensure AWS provider is added: monk cluster provider add -p aws
2) monk update \<namespace>/\<name>

## Auth
- Uses AWS provider credentials configured via monk cluster provider add -p aws

## Getting Started

1) Ensure AWS provider is added:
```bash
monk cluster provider add -p aws
```

2) Define a simple policy (save as iam.yaml):
```yaml
namespace: iam-examples

s3-readonly-policy:
  defines: aws/iam/iam-policy
  region: us-east-1
  policy_name: S3ReadOnlyAccess
  policy_document:
    Version: "2012-10-17"
    Statement:
      - Effect: Allow
        Action:
          - s3:GetObject
          - s3:ListBucket
        Resource:
          - "arn:aws:s3:::my-application-bucket/*"
          - "arn:aws:s3:::my-application-bucket"
```

3) Create/update:
```bash
monk update iam-examples/s3-readonly-policy
monk describe iam-examples/s3-readonly-policy
```
