## What is this integration?
Manage Netlify sites, deploys, and forms via API.

## What Monk manages
- Site, Deploy, Form

## Auth
- Uses a Monk secret (e.g., netlify-api-token)

## Getting Started

1) Set secret:
```bash
monk secrets add -g netlify-api-token="netlify_api_token"
```

2) Define a site and deploy (save as netlify.yaml):
```yaml
namespace: netlify-example

my-site:
  defines: netlify/site
  secret_ref: netlify-api-token
  name: my-awesome-site
  custom_domain: mydomain.com
  permitted-secrets:
    netlify-api-token: true

prod-deploy:
  defines: netlify/deploy
  secret_ref: netlify-api-token
  site_id: \<- connection-target("site") entity-state get-member("id")
  dir: ./dist
  prod: true
  connections:
    site:
      runnable: netlify-example/my-site
      service: data
  depends:
    wait-for:
      runnables:
        - netlify-example/my-site
      timeout: 120
```

3) Create/update:
```bash
monk update netlify-example/my-site
monk update netlify-example/prod-deploy
```
