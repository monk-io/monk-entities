## What is this integration?
Amazon SQS offers a reliable, scalable message queue for decoupling microservices.

## What Monk manages
- Queue: create, update, delete

## What the Agent can do and how to use it
- **Queue Management**: Create, configure, and delete message queues
- **Message Operations**: Send, receive, and delete messages with visibility timeouts
- **Queue Types**: Standard queues (at-least-once delivery) and FIFO queues (exactly-once, ordered)
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Configure DLQs for failed message handling
- **Batching**: Send and receive messages in batches for efficiency
- **Attributes**: Set message attributes, timers, and priority levels
- **Polling**: Configure long/short polling for message retrieval
- **Redrive Policies**: Set up automatic redrive from DLQ back to source queue

Steps:
1) Ensure AWS provider is added: monk cluster provider add -p aws
2) monk update \<namespace>/\<name>

## Auth
- Uses AWS provider credentials configured via monk cluster provider add -p aws

## Getting Started

1) Ensure AWS provider is added:
```bash
monk cluster provider add -p aws
```

2) Define a queue (save as sqs.yaml):
```yaml
namespace: aws-sqs-examples

standard-queue:
  defines: aws-sqs/sqs-queue
  region: us-east-1
  queue_name: standard-example-queue
```

3) Create/update:
```bash
monk update aws-sqs-examples/standard-queue
monk describe aws-sqs-examples/standard-queue
```
